I am a Computational Biologist driven by a deep passion for understanding the complexities of human health and disease. Currently based at Amsterdam UMC, I leverage single-cell multiomics and cutting-edge long-read sequencing technologies to investigate resistance mechanisms in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). With over five years of post-Ph.D. experience, my expertise lies in integrating high-dimensional single-cell data with advanced AI/ML approaches to uncover biologically meaningful patterns that can drive therapeutic innovation.

I specialize in developing and applying robust computational frameworks—primarily using R and Python—to identify novel therapeutic targets and gain insights into disease progression. Throughout my career, I have closely collaborated with clinicians and experimental researchers to bridge the gap between computational biology and translational medicine, particularly in cancer and autoimmune disorders. My overarching goal is to contribute actionable insights that can ultimately improve patient care and treatment outcomes.

Beyond my primary research focus, I am also deeply interested in healthy aging, the role of diet, and the intricate interplay between environment and genotype—factors that may underlie the rising global incidence of cancer.

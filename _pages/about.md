I am a Computational Biologist with a strong passion for unraveling the complexities of human health and disease. Currently, I work at AmsterdamUMC, where I apply single-cell multiomics—with cutting-edge long-read sequencing technologies—to investigate resistance mechanisms in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). With over five years of post-Ph.D. experience, I specialize in integrating single-cell data with advanced AI/ML techniques to uncover biologically meaningful patterns that can drive therapeutic innovations.
My expertise lies in developing and applying robust computational frameworks using R and/or Python to analyze high-dimensional biological data, with a focus on identifying novel therapeutic targets. I actively collaborate with clinicians and experimental researchers to bridge the gap between computational biology and translational medicine, particularly in cancers and autoimmune disorders. Through my work, I aim to contribute actionable insights that can ultimately improve patient care and treatment outcomes.
